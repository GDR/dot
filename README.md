Welcome to my personal NixOS configuration files repository! This repository contains my personal configurations for my NixOS system, including system configuration, user configurations, and package installation specifications.

NixOS is a powerful and flexible Linux distribution that uses a purely functional package management system. With NixOS, you can declare your entire system configuration as a single text file, which makes it easy to manage and reproduce your system on multiple machines.

In this repository, you will find my personal NixOS configurations, which include various customizations and tweaks to make my system work the way I like. You can use these configurations as a starting point for your own system, or you can use them as a reference for learning more about NixOS and its configuration system.

## What's Inside

* AwesomeWM — highly configurable, next generation framework window manager for X.
* Rofi — highly customizable dmenu replacement.
* Kitty — really fast and thin terminal emulator.
* ZSH/Powerline10k — on of the best shells with cute theme.

## Installation

For a basic isntall you should proceed to official Nixos documentation.

After you get to your system run make command:

```
$ make switch-nix
```
